## A Collection of custom blocks and utils using Keras

I'm collecting here different utilities, like custom blocks (stacks of layers) and data generators with the hope of being reusable in future.

### TODO:

 * Document code
 * Document here
 * Eventually it might make sense to migrate to tf.keras (I'm using TensorFlow as backend)

### References

 * Keras https://keras.io/
 * TemporalConvNet is based on https://medium.com/the-artificial-impostor/notes-understanding-tensorflow-part-3-7f6633fcc7c7 and https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn
